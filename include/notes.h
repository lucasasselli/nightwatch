    "sorry I couldn't be there for your first day! I'm a lousy boss: the sooner you get used to it, the better.\n\n"
    "'But Joe, if you are not here how can you possibly check that I do my job!'\n\n"
    "Excellent question! For starters, nightwatch man is not a hard job: you need to watch things, and must be night. "
    "Also, the entrace shutter locks automatically and you need a code for it. So, unless your plan for the next "

    "What I can tell you is that you won't find the entrance code here, so, take a look around, explore the museum, DO YOUR DAMN JOB and you might "
    "find it!\n\n"
    "Or you can try all the combinations: I can't stop you.",

    // Note 3
    "Welcome to the north wing young Padawan. The first trial is over, and you passed it! Pat yourself on the back and be proud of yourself, because "
